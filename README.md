# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

Our work on the SellBy project was so successful, weâ€™ve been tasked with another, larger project. We are to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. SellBy pay a fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

I chose to analyze the amazon_reviews_us_Sports data set. As shown in figures 1, I used PySpark to take the amazon_reviews_us_Sports dataset and import it to a dataframe. As shown in figures 2 through 6, I performed the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance. I used pgAdmin to create data tables using sql. From the AWS RDS instance, I loaded the transformed data into the pgAdmin tables. Figures 7 through 10 show each of the tables in pgAdmin filled with the transformed data. I then used PySparkto determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.

## Results:

### How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

*Figure 11: total_ratings_df *<br />

 * There are a total of 334 Vine reviews <br />
 * There are a total of 61614 non-vine reviews <br />

### How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

  * There are a total of 139 5 star Vine reviews <br />
  * There are a total of 32665 5 star non-vine reviews <br />

### What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

  * The percentage of Vine reviews that were 5 stars is 41.62% (rounded) <br />
  * The percentage of non-Vine reviews that were 5 stars is 53.02% (rounded) <br />

## Summary: 
Based on our analysis of the amazon_reviews_us_Sports data set, we can comfortably say that there is not a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. As shown in figure 11, our percentage of 5 star reviews given by vine members is about than 12% lower than those given by non-vine reviews. This lower percentage doesn't fit the expected results for a positivity bias, which would expect vine reviews to have a higher 5 star percentage than the non-Vine reviewer. To better support our argument, we could evaluate the remaining ratings on the review scale. Evaluating the 1, 2, 3 and 4 star reviews between the Vine and non-Vine reviews in additon to evaluating different datasets would better support our initial observation that Vine reviews do not show positivity bias.
