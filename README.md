# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

Our work on the SellBy project was so successful, weâ€™ve been tasked with another, larger project. We are to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. SellBy pay a fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

I chose to analyze the amazon_reviews_us_Sports data set. I used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance. I used pgAdmin to create data tables using sql. From the AWS RDS instance, I loaded the transformed data into the pgAdmin tables. I then used PySparkto determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.

## Results:

### How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
